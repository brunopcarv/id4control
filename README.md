# Identification for Control

The repository contains recent identification methods for controlling nonlinear dynamical systems.
Modules are classified into 5 groups: linear and nonlinear system model examples, linear and nonlinear identification methods, linear and nonlinear control methods, sampling algorithms, and simulations (performance evaluation).
